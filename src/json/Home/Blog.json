Most plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight. If your balcony is shaded, opt for shade-tolerant plants. Size: Measure your balcony space to understand how much room you have for pots and plants. This will help you plan your garden layout effectively. Weight Limit: Check the weight limit of your balcony, as large pots and soil can add significant weight.
